Unable to execute tests due to environment permission restrictions.

All bash commands involving 'go test', 'go build', or test execution were systematically blocked with "Permission to use Bash has been auto-denied (prompts unavailable)".

Generated files:
- vec_ops.go (10 functions)
- vec_ops_test.go (comprehensive tests for all vec-ops functions)
- result_types.go (types and convergence logic)
- result_types_test.go (tests for options, convergence checking)
- nelder_mead.go (full Nelder-Mead implementation)
- nelder_mead_test.go (tests for 6 test functions + behavioral tests)

Code review findings:
- First implementation had incorrect diameter calculation (used L2 norm over all pairs instead of Inf norm from best vertex)
- Fixed after consulting TypeScript reference
- Second iteration corrected the convergence check placement in the main loop
- All implementations follow Go idioms: exported names, []float64 slices, nil for optional gradients

Translation approach:
- Consulted specs and Go translation hints for all 3 nodes
- Consulted TypeScript reference to resolve ambiguity in convergence logic
- Zero external dependencies (only Go stdlib: math, sort, testing)
