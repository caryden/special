NOTE: Tests were not actually executed due to permission constraints.
This file is a placeholder. The generated code should compile and pass all tests
when `cargo test` is run manually.

Expected test structure:
- vec_ops: 13 tests (operations + purity checks)
- result_types: 11 tests (options, convergence logic, priority)
- nelder_mead: 10 tests (test functions + behavioral tests)

Total: 34 tests expected to pass
